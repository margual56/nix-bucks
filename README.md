**Roadmap**: [watch here](https://github.com/users/margual56/projects/5/views/1)

# Install
If you are on Linux, you can download the Appimage from the latest release ([click here](https://github.com/margual56/nix-bucks/releases)).
Otherwise, you can install from the .deb package.

## About windows
"Smart Screen" will yell at you when you try to open this program, because it is not signed by a "trusted" source.
FYI, in this case a "trusted" source means literally anyone who has $2,000/year to spend on a key to sign the program.

Since I don't have a disposable $2K/year, just click "Show more" > "Run anyway".

# Usage
Remember that you can back up the config file, and also you can create copies to test new arrangements :)

# Planning
## Goals
- Provide a simple way to track subscription costs, expenses and income
- Provide the bottomline information that we want to know (montly balance, how much money will I have, etc)
- Store the information locally, while allowing for easy manual editing, parsing and reading of it.
- Zero tracking, 100% local processing
- Use the least amount of resources possible
- Be accurate

## Non-goals
- Provide detailed information
- Do statistics with the data

# Help!
If you know Rust and think you can help, please do! :)

And if you don't, you can also [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/margual56). Even a small amount really helps.
